## AR 3D Box Maze for Orbital 2018 
## Proposed Level of Achievement: Gemini

This application allows users to create a 3D box maze game in an augmented reality environment. It allows the gamer to roam and change the augmented reality world at will just like a sandbox. The app gives users the ability to create their own set of maze game obstacles, routes and characters in an augmented reality environment which can be uploaded to the database for other users to play.

## Target Audience: Freshmen in Computing

## Problem Motivation

Our initial motivation came from wanting an orientation activity for computing freshmen where they can create something out of almost nothing (just like coding) and let their peers try out their game. We believe that our orientation should allow freshmen to learn and experience building something which has meaning and gives them a sense of fufilment. The feeling of achievement and fufilment from using this application to create a 3D maze for their peers gives the freshmen a peek into what it is going to be like coding. Just like coding, building a 3D maze (especially in an augmented reality) requires some strategy and critical thinking. As such, we want this application to allow freshmen to have a peek into the coding life.

Also, the reason why we chose augmented reality is because it allows for more interaction with the external environment and it is would intrigue the freshmen more as it is a relatively new aspect for mobile phone games.


## Proposed Core Features / Steps to create a maze

### Maze Builder
**1. Lay out your maze** - Users can use cube, cuboid etc shapes to build their maze as walls

**2. Up, Down, Left, Right and Delete/Undo button controls** - Control buttons for users to decide where to place the walls of their maze in a 3D environment 

### Object Builder
**1. Cube, Cuboid, Circular shape objects** - Users can use these shape objects to build their maze game character and objects to put in their maze sandbox. Each object should be given a colour code by the users (Red - Obstacles, Blue - Clues, Yellow - neutral)

**2. Up, Down, Left, Right and Delete/Undo button controls** - Control buttons for users to decide where to place an object in their maze sandbox in a 3D environment 

### Background Designer
**1. Background choices** - Different background settings for users to choose and edit for their maze sandbox

### Obstacles/Clue Designer
For objects with red colour code (obstacles), users will be able to choose the type of obstacles they plan to put there. Options such as riddles, questions, sudokus and etc will be given to the users. Questions and answers can be set by the users themselves while riddles will be preset.

For objects with blue colour code (clues), users will be able to key in the clue for the maze which will be given to the gamer who touches these objects.

### Delete/Edit button
Users will be able to scroll through the list of objects they made and have the option to delete or edit them

## Plan
1st week of July: Increase saving database and allow user to create obstacles
2nd week of July: Player gameplay mode to be finalised
3rd week of July: Background sourcing and designing
4th week of July: Improve user interface, main menu, final enhancement
